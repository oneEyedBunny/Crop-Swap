# Pending
1. readMe pics

-----------------------------------------------------------------

# Stretch Goals
1. Create way for user to use gravatar for photo of self or users to upload a
    photo of themselves
1. Create way for users to upload photos of their swaps (S3)
1. Create way for user to modify their username
1. Create way for private messaging within the app

# Code Improvements
1. create function for login/logout, that works more cohesively, so I don't have to copy paste the and tweak it in each file. Also could I do a require in each file and export from just one place?
1. Need to check code to see where I'm rejecting non trimmed username/pw (userroutes.js line 54)

# Crop-Swap

# Summary
Crop Swap is designed to help people connect with their neighbors so they can swap excess fruits/veggies/herbs whenever or wherever they like.

# Motivation
I'm a fan of gardening and eating what you grow, but when your what you grow goes gangbusters, it gets old
eating the same thing day in and out, and who wants to waste the food? Once a week people from my neighborhood would get together, bring what excess they have and swap stuff out. I realized if there was away for people to connect on a broader level or on different days, even more swaping could be done.
